# Experimenting with PyGame

Experimenting with Pygame following a range of tutorials.

No aim and objective in mind.

## Camera, Collisions, Animation states and particle effects

### Collisions

Difficult to handle collisions in pygame. Detection works but direction is always unclear. Workaround is to seperate the x and y movement. 

It is easier to handle collisions in the level than in the player.

### Animations

Change multiple images very fast, or loop through a list of images.
